# @cosyte/fhir: Project Guide for Claude

## Project

**`@cosyte/fhir`**: a developer-focused FHIR parser + utility library for Node.js/TypeScript,
published under the Cosyte brand. Open-source (MIT). The FHIR member of the cosyte parser suite; it
mirrors the API shape of `@cosyte/hl7`, the reference parser.

**North star:** A developer can read a real-world FHIR resource, model it with correct primitive
semantics, and validate it against US Core, without reading the FHIR spec.

## Status

- **Pre-alpha, unpublished on npm.** No version of `@cosyte/fhir` has ever reached the registry:
  every publish attempt is rejected with `E403` by npm's name-similarity filter, on account of the
  unscoped `fhir` package (FHIR-NPM-NAME; support request filed 2026-07-23). `package.json`
  therefore runs ahead of the registry rather than behind it, so read the version there and never
  infer it from npm. **Phases 1–9 landed; P10 landed (halves a + b); P11 buildable
  tiers landed.** P11 (buildable portion; roadmap §6): conformance hardening as gating tests: a
  **JSON+XML+NDJSON fuzz tier** (`test/fuzz.test.ts`, `FUZZ_RUNS`-tunable, a dedicated `fuzz` CI job)
  proving adversarial input never crashes/hangs/OOMs: only a **typed** `FhirCodecError`/`FhirXmlError`
  with a registered fatal, or a bounded rejection; a **PHI-leak tier** (`test/phi-leak.test.ts`, corpus
  sweep + sentinel battery) gating the value-free-diagnostics contract; a **type-level tier**
  (`test/public-types.test.ts`, `expect-type`). The fuzz tier surfaced three read-path robustness
  defects, now fixed: a **decimal DoS** (`0e9999999999999999999` made `FhirDecimal` quantity comparison
  do `10n ** astronomical-scale` → untyped `RangeError`/hang on the read path: now canonical-form
  comparison, no exponentiation, semantics unchanged); an **XML entity prototype-chain bypass**
  (`&constructor;`/`&__proto__;` resolved through `Object.prototype`, bypassing the five-entity
  allowlist: now `Object.hasOwn`-guarded); and a **validator DoS** (a resource property named
  `constructor`/`toString` crashed `validateResource` with an uncaught `TypeError`: now
  `Object.hasOwn`-guarded). New public fatal `FATAL_CODES.MAX_DEPTH_EXCEEDED` (JSON reader bounds
  nesting at 256, matching the XML reader). **Deferred:** the JVM `validator_cli.jar` differential is
  **authored but CI-only** (`scripts/differential.mjs` + a `differential` CI job: no Java in this
  container, not observed green here); as of **P10b** it runs over **both** the synthetic spec-clean
  tier **and** the Tier-2 quirk corpus. P10 (half a):
  the profile growth loop (profiling.html): `defineProfile()` authors a `StructureDefinition` in code
  from an ergonomic `ProfileSpec`/`ProfileElementSpec` and returns the **same model**
  `loadStructureDefinition` produces from JSON (proven byte-for-byte equal for a valid spec: one
  path, **no privileged internal shape**), flowing straight into `validateResource({ profiles })`; a
  conservative writer that throws a value-free `InvalidProfileError` on an author mistake. A
  publishable, spec-grounded **starter kit** (`VITAL_SIGN_OBSERVATION_STARTER`,
  `PATIENT_IDENTIFIER_STARTER`, `STARTER_PROFILES`, `starterProfile`, `STARTER_PROFILE_BASE_URL`)
  dogfoods it: each starter is a `defineProfile()` call, self-contained (differential-only, no bundled
  base), a _template_ not an authoritative vendor conformance statement. **Half (b): the Tier-2
  real-world _quirk_ corpus + the `validator_cli.jar` differential over it, landed (ADR 0018):** five
  quirk fixtures (`test/__fixtures__/quirk-*.json`), each **grounded in a public artifact** and cited
  in `test/quirk-corpus.test.ts` (the provenance record): a non-first `resourceType` (json.html), a
  scientific-notation decimal (Synthea #675, preserved byte-exact + `DECIMAL_PRECISION_AT_RISK`), a
  primitive-extension `_`-sibling misalignment that **fails closed** (HAPI #5738), a searchset Bundle
  `link[next]` that survives the round-trip (bundle-example.json), and US Core race + birthsex
  extensions preserved on a base Patient. Values are synthetic; the PHI-leak sweep auto-covers them.
  ADR 0018 redefined the anti-invention rule's "real document" to include public artifacts, unblocking
  this from `REAL-CORPUS`. A genuinely vendor-**proprietary** deviation absent from every public sample
  stays grounded-only (still forbidden to invent, conventions §PHI); missing-must-support
  (`MUST_SUPPORT_ABSENT`) and version-drift (`PROFILE_VERSION_MISMATCH`) quirks are already covered by
  the Phase-6 profile suite. `scripts/differential.mjs` runs this corpus through the oracle in the
  `differential` CI job (still JVM-only, not observed green here). P9: Bundles, references, Bulk NDJSON
  streaming (bundle.html / references.html / Bulk Data IG): the `Bundle` model + entry-processing
  semantics (`readBundle` / `entryProcessing` / `isAtomicBundle` / `BUNDLE_TYPES`) that keep
  **transaction = all-or-nothing (`"atomic"`) genuinely distinct from batch = independent
  (`"independent"`)**: the artifact + semantics are modeled, transactions are **never executed** (no
  server; stated non-goal); reference resolution (`resolveReference` / `buildBundleIndex` /
  `containedIndex`) for relative / absolute / logical / `#fragment` against a Bundle + `contained`
  closure (a local miss → `"unresolved"`, an out-of-closure target → `"external"`, never
  false-flagged), keyed version-free; a **DoS-safe cycle guard** (`hasContainedCycle` /
  `MAX_REFERENCE_DEPTH`): an iterative, heap-based, three-color DFS that detects and reports a
  contained reference cycle rather than looping (terminates always, no false positive on a DAG); and a
  **streaming `application/fhir+ndjson` reader** (`streamNdjson` / `parseNdjsonLine` /
  `NDJSON_ERROR_CODES`) with **per-line error isolation** (malformed line → isolated value-free error,
  stream continues, reported by line number never content) and **no whole-file load** (only the current
  partial line buffered; an unterminated line cut off `LINE_TOO_LONG` and drained without accumulating),
  each line read through the precision-preserving codec (a decimal never through a JS `number`). New
  value-free findings wired into `validateResource` for a `Bundle`: `REFERENCE_UNRESOLVED` (warning,
  preserved), `CONTAINED_CYCLE` (error), `FULLURL_ID_MISMATCH` (error, `urn:uuid` fullUrl exempt); adds
  the R4 `not-found` `IssueType`. Deferred, fail-safe intact: no transaction **execution**. P8: XML codec + cross-format equivalence
  (xml.html): a **zero-dependency** FHIR XML codec that reads/writes the **same schema-free model** as
  the JSON codec. `parseResourceXml` (→ shared `ReadResult`) / `serializeResourceXml` (spec-clean,
  byte-for-byte round-trip), a hardened raw reader `readRawXml` (→ `XmlElement` tree) that is **XXE- and
  billion-laughs-proof by refusal**: it refuses any `<!DOCTYPE` (`DTD_FORBIDDEN`, closing the XXE and
  billion-laughs vectors at once) and any entity beyond the five predefined + numeric character
  references (`UNDEFINED_ENTITY`), does no I/O, resolves no URI, and bounds depth (`MAX_DEPTH_EXCEEDED`),
  via `FhirXmlError` / `XML_FATAL_CODES`. Mapping: root/contained element name → synthetic
  `resourceType`; `value` attribute → primitive value **kept as its lexical string** (schema-free, no
  datatype guessed, precision never through a `number`); `id`/`extension` co-located (`id` attr + child
  `<extension>`s, the XML `_`-sibling); `Element.id`/`Extension.url` attrs → `id`/`url` props; repeated
  elements → list; resource-valued element unwrapped; narrative `Narrative.div` carried **opaquely** as
  its full XHTML string (the FHIR JSON representation) → round-trips as conformant `<div>…</div>`, never
  dropped/escaped. `nodesEquivalent` is the JSON↔XML equivalence oracle: equal **modulo** primitive
  lexical form and singleton lists (array-of-one ≡ one element), and only those. Lenient reads
  preserve-and-flag an unexpected namespace / stray text (new value-free issue code
  `UNEXPECTED_XML_CONTENT`). Deferred, fail-safe intact: XHTML **structure** inside `div` not
  modeled/validated (carried opaque, never dropped); typed cross-format transcoding (spec-clean JSON
  booleans/numbers from an XML model) needs the datatype schema; an extension-only element with no value
  reads as a primitive (schema-free ambiguity, documented on `nodesEquivalent`, safe direction);
  RDF/Turtle out of scope; XML-fuzz differential vs `validator_cli.jar` (Phase 11). P7:
  invariants via a bounded, vendored
  FHIRPath subset (the sixth-and-final validation layer, ADR 0002): an in-repo FHIRPath **lexer →
  parser → evaluator** (`tokenize` / `parseFhirPath` / `evaluateInvariant`; no runtime dependency, no
  full third-party engine) that evaluates a profile's `constraint[]` against an instance. The subset
  covers the R4 / US Core invariant surface: path/choice navigation, `$this`/`%resource`/`%context`,
  `exists`/`empty`/`not`/`where`/`all`/`select`/`count`/`first`/`last`/`distinct`/`hasValue`/`children`/
  `extension`/`intersect`, three-valued `and`/`or`/`xor`/`implies`, `=`/`!=`/`<`/`>`/`<=`/`>=`/`in`/
  `contains`/`|`, and System-type `is`/`as`/`ofType`, judged by the reference validator's boolean
  coercion (empty → violation, never a silent pass). `collectInvariantIssues` (wired into
  `validateResource({ profiles })`) emits `INVARIANT_VIOLATED` (severity mirrors the constraint's
  `error`|`warning`) or, for **any** expression outside the subset, `INVARIANT_UNCHECKED` (information)
  via `UnsupportedFhirPathError`: surfaced, **never assumed to pass** (roadmap §6 fail-safe).
  `loadStructureDefinition` now parses `constraint[]` (`ElementConstraint`); `generateSnapshot`
  accumulates invariants down the derivation chain. The seven named safety invariants
  (`ait`/`con`/`obs`) stay owned by the always-on Phase-3 safety layer (the engine skips those keys and
  covers every other constraint). Deferred, fail-safe intact: `type`/`profile` slicing discriminators
  and reslicing (still `PROFILE_SLICE_UNCHECKED`); bundled US Core IG corpus + `validator_cli.jar`
  differential (Phase 11). P6: StructureDefinition + US Core
  profile validation (the sixth layer): `loadStructureDefinition`; **snapshot generation** from a
  differential (`generateSnapshot` walks `baseDefinition`, merges/tightens by id, inserts slices, fails
  closed with `FhirProfileError` on an unresolvable base / cycle); **slicing** (`resolveSlices` /
  `matchSlices`: R4 discriminators `value|exists|pattern|type|profile`, **`position` R5-only and
  excluded**; unsupported/insufficient discriminators → `PROFILE_SLICE_UNCHECKED`, never silently
  passed); **`fixed[x]` (exact) vs `pattern[x]` (subset)** via `matchesFixed` / `matchesPattern`
  (decimals precision-exact); **must-support as a system obligation** (`MUST_SUPPORT_ABSENT` is
  **information, never error**, not instance-presence); multi-version `PROFILE_VERSION_MISMATCH`
  against `meta.profile` pins; a bounded path navigator (`resolvePath` / `pathExists`). Runs inside
  `validateResource(resource, { profiles, resolveBase })`; **no profile content is bundled** (US
  Core/vendor SDs are supplied by the caller). Deferred: bundled US Core IG corpus + `validator_cli.jar`
  differential (Phase 11); `type`/`profile` discriminators, reslicing, invariant `constraint`s (Phase
  7 FHIRPath). P5: Terminology binding validation
  (strength-aware, content-free): a frozen **known-systems registry** (`KNOWN_SYSTEMS` /
  `isKnownSystem`, the verified §5 `system` URIs as identities: no SNOMED/CPT/LOINC content vendored,
  ICD-10-PCS/HCPCS deliberately omitted per §10); **binding-strength severity** (`required` → error,
  `extensible` → error-unless, `preferred` → warning, `example` → info and never an error) via
  `TERMINOLOGY_BINDINGS` / `buildBindingRegistry`; content-free system checks (`CODE_SYSTEM_UNEXPECTED`
  for a known system outside the binding's value set, `CODE_SYSTEM_UNKNOWN` info for an unrecognized
  one); the roadmap-named **multi-system** bindings (allergy substance RxNorm + SNOMED, medication
  RxNorm); and a **pluggable terminology-service interface** (`TerminologyService`, none bundled) that
  gates the only membership finding (`CODE_NOT_IN_VALUESET`). With no service, checks degrade to the
  content-free system level and never false-error (roadmap §5). `collectTerminologyIssues` runs inside
  `validateResource(resource, { terminology, bindings })`. P4: Quantity / UCUM fidelity (results
  & doses): `readObservationValue` discriminates the **11-way `Observation.value[x]` choice** (branch
  on the present type: a `"POSITIVE"` string or a `1:64` titer is never read as a number); the
  machine-actionable unit is the UCUM **`code`** (not the `unit` string), shape-checked
  (`validateUcumShape`) but never converted; **vital-signs required-unit** conformance
  (`VITAL_SIGN_UNIT_NONCONFORMANT`) against the profile's closed table; UCUM shape warnings
  (`UCUM_UNIT_UNRECOGNIZED`) and `VALUE_TYPE_UNEXPECTED`; dose `Quantity` for
  MedicationRequest/Statement; `interpretation`/`referenceRange` surfaced but never evaluated. P1:
  the no-data-loss core: a
  precision-preserving JSON codec (`parseResource` / `serializeResource` / `readRawJson`), the
  string-backed `FhirDecimal` / `FhirInteger64` primitives (ADR 0001), the primitive-extension
  (`_`-sibling) model with null-padded array alignment, an immutable generic element model
  (`FhirComplex` / `FhirList` / `FhirPrimitive`), `parseReference`, and value-free diagnostics.
  **`FHIR-DUPLICATE-KEY-RETRACTION` (2026-07-28) closed a silent, unsafe-direction defect in this
  core:** a duplicate JSON property name dropped the later value (first-wins, no issue), so
  `{"status":"final",…,"status":"entered-in-error"}` lost the retraction and `readSafety` reported
  `retracted: false, safeToSummarize: true`. Of the three separable decisions, **which value wins is
  deliberately unchanged** (still first-wins: RFC 8259 §4 leaves it undefined, FHIR json.html forbids
  duplicates outright, and last-wins would only move the blind spot); what changed is that the
  shadowed member is now **kept** (`FhirComplex.duplicates`, read via `getAllProperties`) and
  **reported** (`ISSUE_CODES.DUPLICATE_PROPERTY` warning on read, `VALIDATION_CODES.DUPLICATE_PROPERTY`
  **error** in `validateResource`), and that `readSafety` **stops affirming**: **all six** negation reads
  now run over every value written for the element each reads (`status`, `verificationStatus`, `code`,
  `doNotPerform`), and `codingsOf` reads every `coding` plus every `system`x`code` pair inside a repeated
  `Coding` name, so the reported case reads `retracted: true` and a retraction nested one level inside a
  `CodeableConcept` is caught too; and any repeated name anywhere sets `safeToSummarize: false` with the
  locations in `SafetyReadout.shadowedProperties` (`assertSafeToSummarize` throws). The `_`-sibling was
  **last**-wins and silent; it is now first-wins + flagged like everywhere else (its shadowed member is
  not modeled: an R4 `Element` carries `id`/`extension` only, so it cannot make a verdict wrong). The
  writer still emits one member per name, deliberately: both would be invalid FHIR.
  **Refuter pass one (`conformance-refuter`, REFUTED) drove all of that**; it also left two
  `PRE-EXISTING` majors/minors as backlog lines, NOT fixed here: `readObservationValue` still returns
  one of two written `valueQuantity` values with no signal on its own surface (no issue channel), and
  read -> write -> read **launders** the defect (the writer emits the conformant survivor, so the
  re-read is `valid: true`, `safeToSummarize: true`); `serializeResource`/`serializeResourceXml` return a
  bare string with no channel to say so. P2:
  the first three validation layers (`validateResource`: structure, cardinality, primitive /
  enumerated-`code` value-domain) with a value-free `OperationOutcome` and the PHI redaction
  chokepoint. P3: the safety-critical status & negation spine (`readSafety`, fail-closed on an
  unknown `modifierExtension`, `entered-in-error` retraction, and the `ait`/`con`/`obs` invariants).
  Reads, round-trips, structurally validates, never drops a modifier / status / negation, and now
  surfaces measured values by their true `value[x]` type with UCUM-`code` unit fidelity (P4, never
  converting a unit), and validates code `system`s + binding strength content-free (P5, no
  terminology content vendored), and validates resources against caller-supplied US Core / vendor
  `StructureDefinition`s (snapshot generation, slicing, fixed/pattern, must-support-as-obligation,
  P6, no profile content bundled) and evaluates profile `constraint[]` invariants through a bounded
  in-repo FHIRPath engine, reporting anything outside the subset `INVARIANT_UNCHECKED` rather than
  passing it (P7), and reads & writes **FHIR XML** into the same model as JSON (the two wire formats
  proven equivalent, the reader XXE/billion-laughs-proof by refusal, P8) but with **no** `type`·`profile`
  slicing discriminators / reslicing (still `PROFILE_SLICE_UNCHECKED`), no bundled US Core IG corpus or
  `validator_cli.jar` differential (P11), no code-validity / value-set-membership guarantee without a supplied
  terminology service, and no typed per-resource models. The roadmap lives in
  the meta-repo: `operations/roadmaps/fhir.md` (P0…P11).

## Tech Stack (the shared `@cosyte/*` standard)

fhir inherits the canonical toolchain by depending on the published `@cosyte/*` config packages, not
by copying files. The source of truth is the meta-repo's `documentation/conventions.md`. This is a
summary.

- **Language:** TypeScript (strict, full rigor set incl. `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`) via
  `@cosyte/tsconfig`. **Target ES2023**, `NodeNext`.
- **Build:** dual ESM + CJS + `.d.ts` via `tsup` (`@cosyte/tsup-config`); `attw` is a publish gate.
- **Node:** **>= 22**.
- **Package manager:** `pnpm@10`.
- **Lint/format:** **ESLint 10** (`@cosyte/eslint-config`) + Prettier (`@cosyte/prettier-config`).
  Lint at `--max-warnings=0`.
- **Testing:** **Vitest 4** + v8 coverage (`@cosyte/vitest-config`). Per-directory >= 90 gates come
  online in Phase 1 when real code lands (P0 holds them at 0: there is no logic to cover yet).
- **CI/CD:** thin callers of the reusable `cosyte/.github` workflows.
- **Runtime deps:** **Zero.** Node stdlib only.
- **License:** MIT.

## The four architecture ADRs (read before writing any parser code)

Recorded in `documentation/decisions/` at bootstrap because they shape everything:

1. **`0001`: decimal / integer64 representation.** String-backed; MUST preserve lexical precision.
   `0.010` is not `0.01`. **Never** round-trip `decimal`/`integer64` through the JS `number` type.
   That is a silent-data-corruption hazard for doses, lab values, and identifiers.
2. **`0002`: FHIRPath posture.** Implement a bounded, vendored subset in-repo. No runtime
   dependency, no full third-party engine. Needed for invariants + slicing (Phase 7).
3. **`0003`: XML scope.** JSON-first; XML serialization deferred to Phase 8.
4. **`0004`: R4-first.** `4.0.1` is the modeled version (ONC HTI-1 / §170.315(g)(10) anchor). R5 /
   DSTU2 are read-tolerance only.

## Engineering Guardrails

- No `any`. No unjustified `as` casts. Use `unknown` and narrow.
- JSDoc (with `@example`) on every public export: feeds IntelliSense.
- Immutable by default. Mutation only via explicit methods.
- No `console.*` in library code. Throw typed errors or return results.
- Postel's Law: the reader is liberal (lenient default + warnings), the writer is conservative
  (always emits spec-clean FHIR).
- **PHI discipline:** synthetic-only fixtures, redaction in logs. Never commit realistic PHI. A
  vendor quirk is encoded only when a real de-identified resource grounds it, never invented.

## Standing disciplines (every change)

Mirrors the three disciplines in the meta-repo's `documentation/conventions.md`. They bind here too:

1. **Documentation follows code**: a change to the public surface/stack/status isn't done until the
   docs are: this repo's docs, the meta-repo `documentation/repos/fhir.md`, and the
   `ecosystem-map.md` status table.
2. **Version + changelog**: a Changeset (`patch` on the `0.0.x` ladder) + a `CHANGELOG.md`
   `[Unreleased]` entry per meaningful change.
3. **Crew + knowledgebase loop**: if the public API changes, flag/update the matching `crew`
   healthcare skill (`fhir-resource-design`) + the KB product doc.
4. **No internal project bookkeeping on a public surface** (founder directive, 2026-07-27). What a
   consumer reads (`README.md`, `docs-content/`, the npm `description`, a release body, the JSDoc
   their editor renders, the text their log prints) says what the software does and what changed.
   Item identifiers (`FHIR-P10`), phase and wave language, ADR numbers, meta-repo paths and "how
   this got built" commentary belong in the changeset, `CHANGELOG.md`, the commit, the PR and the
   roadmap. It is a **translation** at the boundary, not a deletion, and when you strip an
   identifier off the front of a line, repair the head: a fragment reads worse than the text it
   replaced. Gated by `pnpm check:no-internal-refs` (`.github/workflows/no-internal-refs.yml`, job
   id `no-internal-refs`). The gate keys on known project prefixes, so **a new programme prefix has
   to be added to it by hand**; and it catches identifiers, not English sentences about our process,
   so the reviewer still owns half the rule.

   **Three source surfaces, three different answers.** `/** */` doc comments compile into
   `dist/*.d.ts` and render in a consumer's editor, so they are **gated** (they were the larger half
   here by an order of magnitude: 255 hits against 23 on the whole public markdown surface). String
   literals reach a consumer as message text, so they are **gated too** (measured zero hits here,
   because this library's diagnostics are value-free by contract, an `IssueCode` plus a FHIRPath
   expression). `//` and plain `/* */` comments are **not gated** and identifiers are **welcome** in
   them, because **the convention says source comments are a place identifiers belong**. That is the
   whole reason. **Do not justify this boundary from what reaches `dist/`** (everything in `src/`
   does: `dist` is `files[0]`, there is no `.npmignore`, and `dist/*.map` carries every tracked
   source byte in `sourcesContent`). The line is what a consumer is **shown**, not what lands on
   their disk. Also: **removing a doc comment to satisfy the gate is a regression**, not a fix.

   **This copy of the gate diverges from `hl7`/`ncpdp` in exactly one place, and the divergence is a
   REMOVAL: there is no `slice` rule here.** `slice` is R4 vocabulary in this package
   (`ElementDefinition.slicing`, `sliceName`), not our jargon. Measured with the sibling rule
   enabled: **41 matches, one of them ours.** A 1-in-41 rule tells a remediator to rewrite reference
   material, which is the defect the whole gate exists to prevent, and no lookahead narrows it
   because the collision is with the head noun. The ordinal arm of the phase rule
   ("thirteenth slice") still fires. **Do not paste the rule back without re-measuring.**

   **Two holes worth knowing, both left open on purpose.** (a) The identifier form this repo
   actually writes, `FHIR-P10b`, is **not** caught: the trailing lowercase suffix breaks the word
   boundary, and the bare `P10b` / `P9` forms have no prefix to key on. Closing either needs a
   `P\d+`-shaped rule, which in an earlier `hl7` draft corrupted the ICD-10-CM codes in
   "Map ICD-10 P07, P22 and P29" and truncated the range "P00-P96"; this README carries ICD-10-CM
   codes today. The widening belongs in the one shared prefix list, not in a divergent copy.
   (b) `phase` at the end of a clause ("decoded this phase.") is not caught, inherited from `hl7`
   for the clinical-English collision. Both are the reviewer's catch.

   **`CHANGELOG.md` is deliberately NOT scanned even though it ships inside the npm tarball.** The
   convention names it as one of the places identifiers belong, and rewriting a released changelog's
   history destroys the traceability that same convention preserves. That contradiction is
   ecosystem-wide, `hl7` and `ncpdp` exclude it on identical reasoning, and it is **recorded, not
   decided** here.
