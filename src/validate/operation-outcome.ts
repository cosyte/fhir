/**
 * The `OperationOutcome` builder, the value-free wire form of a validation result.
 *
 * `OperationOutcome` is FHIR's standard "here is what I found" resource (operationoutcome.html). The
 * builder turns a list of {@link ValidationIssue}s into an immutable {@link FhirComplex} model that
 * serializes to spec-clean FHIR JSON via {@link ../codec/write.js}. Every issue carries:
 *
 * - `severity`, the R4 severity (`fatal | error | warning | information`);
 * - `code`, the R4 `IssueType`;
 * - `expression`, the FHIRPath *location* (a repeating element), whose segments are the document's
 *   own names bounded to the published form of a FHIR name. A name outside that form reads as the
 *   {@link ../model/path.js} `WITHHELD` marker, and an expression carrying one is a location with a
 *   gap rather than a path that resolves against the instance, so the outcome is spec-clean as a
 *   resource while that one element is deliberately not resolvable; and
 * - `diagnostics`, a value-free line derived **only** from the validation code (the redaction
 *   chokepoint in {@link ./issues.js}). No instance value ever reaches this resource.
 *
 * An `OperationOutcome.issue` is `1..*`, it must carry at least one issue. When validation found
 * nothing, {@link toOperationOutcome} emits a single `information` / `informational` "all clear"
 * issue rather than an (invalid) empty one. R4 has no `success` severity (that is R5),
 * so the all-clear is `information`.
 *
